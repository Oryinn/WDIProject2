In this project I used Node, Express, Mongo, mongoose, and handlebars to create an inventory management system for a secondhand consignment shop. 
The libraries I used were: bcrypt, morgan, connect-flash, cookie-parser, dotenv, express, express-sessions, handlebars, method-override, mongoose, and passport.

In version 2 I would like to add more admin functionality to track total profit/loss, income per month, etc. I would also like to add non-admin users designated as "scouts" that would be able to submit information of potential items that the owner can go purchase and resell in his shop. Tracking which scout uploaded the find so they could be compensated accordingly.
